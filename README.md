# Welcome to your first experience with C#!

In this project, you will find a small console line app with two parts: one to make a grocery list and one 'guess a number' game. For the grocery list app, the user will input the items they want from the grocery store, and on the "Enter" keypress, the console will return the list. The 'Guess a Number' game will let the user try to guess the number it selected at random. The user will have 4 tries and the console line app will let the user know if their guess is too high or too low.

It will be your job to read all of the code, try to soak in some of the new syntax, and complete the areas where the comments ask you to add in code. Don't worry or get too caught up on things you may not fully understand yet-- this is just an introduction and a fun way to get used to C#.
